# Resource Management
 ## A mod that makes the oxygen and fuel in your ship matter.

 This mod changes and adds a few mechanics regarding your ship's oxygen and fuel tank. The changes are the following:

 ### Increased fuel usage
 In Vanilla Outer Wilds, you could spend the entire loop flying around and you'd never run out of fuel! Well, that's not the case anymore, so keep an eye on that **gauge** or you might not have enough fuel to keep the lights on... Or move, for that matter.

 ### Increased oxygen usage
 Same as fuel, in Vanilla Outer Wilds you could survive the entire loop and you'd barely notice a change on your fuel tank, but with this mod your oxygen tank will last for a **bit less than half the loop**. I guess the tank doesn't have as much oxygen as it seems... Oh, and don't sit in the cockpit if you're out of oxygen, as Hatchling has a *tendency* to take of their helmet to fly.

 ### Fuel tank regeneration
 Slate is testing some brand new technology on your ship that allows it to regenerate lost fuel by extracting carbon molecules from the ground. For this though, your ship must **be landed and still**. This will be indicated by a green light below your fuel gauge.

 ### Oxygen tank refilling
 Slate also installed a new air compressor on your ship that will slowly refill your oxygen tank whenever it's in presence of oxygen. This will be indicated by a green light below your oxygen gauge.

 ### New light indicators
 Whenever you're running out of oxygen or fuel, a small light will appear below their gauges once their resource is low.

 That's about it for the changes, have fun.
