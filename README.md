# Resource Management
 ## A mod that makes the oxygen and fuel in your ship matter.

Why in the world would you download this? Doesn't matter. I present to you a direct downgrade to the vanilla ship!

 ### Increased fuel usage
 In Vanilla Outer Wilds, you could spend the entire loop flying around and you'd never run out of fuel! Well, that's not the case anymore, so keep an eye on that **gauge** or you might not have enough fuel to keep the lights on... Or move, for that matter.

 ### Increased oxygen usage
 Same as fuel, in Vanilla Outer Wilds you could survive the entire loop and you'd barely notice a change on your fuel tank, but with this mod your oxygen tank will last for a **bit less than half the loop**. I guess the tank doesn't have as much oxygen as it seems... Oh, and don't sit in the cockpit if you're out of oxygen, as Hatchling has a *tendency* to take of their helmet to fly.

 ### Fuel tank regeneration
 Slate is testing some brand new technology on your ship that allows it to regenerate lost fuel by extracting carbon molecules from the ground. For this though, your ship must **be landed and still**. This will be indicated by a green light below your fuel gauge.

 ### Oxygen tank refilling
 Slate also installed a new air compressor on your ship that will slowly refill your oxygen tank whenever it's in presence of oxygen. This will be indicated by a green light below your oxygen gauge.

 ### New notifications and light indicators
 When you're running a bit low on fuel or oxygen, your ship will *beep* and give you a warning on your ship's console along with a red or yellow light below your fuel / oxygen gauge. Just make sure to check every now and then so you don't run out of oxygen while flying a bit too close to  the sun...

 That's about it for the changes, have fun.

## Planned:
 As for some stuff I'll add in the future, expect being able to use oxygen as fuel, increased regeneration on landing pads, and a small fix that should make regeneration more consistent across different framerates :]
 Any bugs or questions DM me in Discord (Stonesword_) or report it here.
